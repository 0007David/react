Hey.
You did it.
We're here at the end of the course.
You should be so proud of yourself for finishing because assuming you've done all the challenges and projects in this course, you are well on your way to becoming a proficient React developer.
As I said in the very beginning of this course, my philosophy is that the easiest way to get good at something is to put in the work to do it the hard way.
And considering you are here at the end having done all the projects, you have put in the hard work, and I can promise you that it will have been worth it.
Let's take a look back on the projects that we worked on in the different sections of this course and do a quick recap of what we have learned.
In section one, we started with really basic static pages in React so that we could build a solid foundation to support the rest of our learning in React, and we begun that section by first learning why we even care about React in the first place.
We talked about how React is declarative, making it a much better developer experience.
And how React is composable, allowing us to build reusable pieces that can be combined together to make a masterpiece of a web app.
We touched on setting up a new React project, not only in terms of the code that you have to write, but also how to do it on your local machine.
Then we learned about React elements and how JSX was created to make creating those React elements a very familiar experience, similar to writing HTML.
Then we learned about the crux of composability in React by learning about custom components.
Custom components allow us to co locate logic, markup, and styling all in the same place to create a custom reusable piece of code.
And then, of course, we needed to make sure that we added some styling so that we weren't just throwing around ugly components.
With that knowledge, we were able to build our first static React Fax web page.
From there, we moved on to our second section where we built a travel journal.
What set this travel journal apart from the React Facts project is that it was data driven.
We really drove home the concept that reusability is extremely important, and learned how we can take our React components, pass props into them, so that they could be reused in multiple different ways.
Once we knew how to pass props into a component, similar to how you pass parameters into a function, we learned how we can use vanilla JavaScript array methods to create components from an array of data.
Doing this allowed us to put the data for our travel journal in one place and simply map over it to create the ultimate view on the page.
This meant that if we wanted to add new entries to our travel journal or change a detail of one of the items, all we had to do was change it in one place, the data.
Then we really dialed it up to eleven and jumped into this Chef Claude project in section three.
This section was entirely dedicated to building interactive web apps.
Apps.
Whereas before we were working with static read only pages, now we're able to respond to the user's inputs by learning about event listeners and how we can update our app based on the interactions of our users.
We learned about state, which allows us not only to save information between one render and the next, but also allowed us developers to focus on updating the state correctly and letting that flow to the UI, which is what React is intended to do.
Changes to the state will automatically update what the user sees.
We learned about conditional rendering, how we can display or not display certain parts of the webpage based on conditions.
Then we learned about forms and how React nineteen enables an entirely new approach to forms, which is much more closely aligned with how the native web platform handles forms.
And we took a chance to dabble just a little bit into different state management strategies.
Although state management is a rabbit hole that would probably require an entire course of its own.
Then we had a lot of fun building our meme generator and learning about side effects in React.
We began the section by talking about Controlled Components, which are essentially the way that React has approached dealing with forms all the way up until very recently at the time of this recording, but there are scenarios where controlled components can still be useful.
In our case, we wanted to update our state so that the top text would reflect on every keystroke what the user was typing into the input box.
Then we talked a little bit about how React has a philosophical basis in functional programming.
We touched on the concepts of immutability in React and how our components shouldn't affect any outside systems from themselves.
However, the purpose of the Side Effects section is to learn how we can use an escape hatch from that functional programming paradigm when we absolutely need to.
And the way that we did this in our meme generator project was to fetch some data as soon as the component loaded.
Having a so called escape hatch, which gives us a chance to safely handle side effects whenever they're absolutely necessary, Turns out not only to be a really important thing in React, but also one of the more misunderstood aspects of React.
Then we got to the place where the rubber met the road, and that was in our capstone projects.
We built two back to back games that were both really fun to build and legitimately are fun to play.
Hopefully, looking back at all of these sections gives you a really strong sense of appreciation as to how much time and effort you put into this course.
This would be a perfect opportunity for you to head to the Today I Did channel on the SCRIMBA Discord server and post a message, dare I say, brag about this tremendous accomplishment.
Now, I don't want to just leave you hanging at the end of this course, so I wanted to give you some ideas of what you could be working on next.
Naturally, I'd first like to put in a plug for my advanced React course here on Scrimba.
The advanced React course is the natural progression from where we left off at the end of this course.
In that course, we dive deep into reusability in React and learn a bunch of new ways that we can turn our reusable components into even more reusable components.
We learn how to build single page applications using the React router library.
And we learn all about performance in React and how we can improve the performance of our React apps.
Another really important topic you could move on to if you haven't already learned it is TypeScript.
And good news, I also have a TypeScript course here on Scrimba and it is completely free.
I already mentioned React Router, but you could focus specifically on learning the React Router package.
At the time of recording, React router is about to release version seven, which is a completely new version of React router.
If you're looking to go more into a full stack realm, Next.
Js and Remix are awesome frameworks that you can use to be building not only the front ends like we've learned here in React, but also the back end so you can handle server interactions, data, caching, cookies, and all of that.
If you are interested in back end, you could go the direct back end route by learning Node.
Js with or without Express, all to help you build REST APIs that your front end React apps can consume.
And last but certainly not least, you could learn about deployment and how you can get your apps live on the web for your friends, family, and potential future employers to check out.

It has been my absolute pleasure to teach this course and guide you through learning React.

I would certainly appreciate a follow.
And, folks, that's all I have left to say except for congratulations on completing this learn react course.
